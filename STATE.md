## Status note

Phase 2 in progress. Modeling implements Phase 2 **baselines only** under `src/nowcaster/models/`: `last_value`, `ar1`, `rolling_mean`, each with `fit` / `predict` → point + 80%/95% intervals, plus `create_baseline` / `iter_baselines` for the evaluation harness. Plain-language pages in `docs/models/`. Features API still incomplete — baselines use synthetic fixtures and `docs/requests/features-baseline-xy-contract.md`.
