## Status note

Phase 3 is **complete** on `main` (#21 + #20; post-merge `ci` green). Phase 4 **in progress**. Security (Role 8) PR [#24](https://github.com/Yuvraj2006py/ca-nowcaster/pull/24): `docs/security_review.md`, failure-mode recovery doc, CI hardenings, and `docs/requests/` for Ingestion/Live/Dashboard. Live and Dashboard still stubs on main — Security will re-check those surfaces after they land.
